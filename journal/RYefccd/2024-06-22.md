 ptr_name is any pointer name of your choice.
file_name is the name of the fle that you want to open with full address path.

mode determines the various operations allowed to perform on the fle. Various fle opening modes are as follows: 
r, rb – read only mode, return the address of the frst character. 
w, wb – write only mode, return the address of the frst character. 
a, ab – use to append content at the end of the fle, return the address of the last character. r+, rb+ or w+, wb+ – read, write, or modify the content, return the address of the frst character. 
a+, ab+ – read or append content, but modifcation is not allowed.
