> [!NOTE] glibc
> Glibc (short for GNU Libc, or GNU C Library) is a library that provides the interface between application programs and the Linux kernel. Although its official name is the "C" library (library for programs written in the "C" language), virtually all dynamically linked program binaries depend on it - it is the de-facto system library in almost all Linux operating systems.
Glibc is in active development and new versions are released from time-to-time; and this poses a problem: what would happen for application and program binaries originally built to run with a different version of glibc than the one currently installed in your operating system?
Glibc has a versioning system that allows backward compatibility (older programs built to run on older versions of glibc will continue to run on new glibc); but it is of no help the other way around: programs that depend on newer glibc will usually **not** run on systems with older glibc.
There is a way.


> [!NOTE] Final Notes
> The method explained in this article is not the only one. There are many other ways to do same; most of them will recommend to:1. Upgrade glibc (if possible).
>2. Install a newer version of glibc in a non-standard location and wrap the binaries with scripts that start them with an explicit call to the dynamic linker (ld-linux.so).
>3. Install a newer version of glibc in a chroot and run the applications in the chroot.
>They all have their own merits and should definitely be considered. The method I outlined above is one which is reserved for the last resort when none of the above (and others) are possible for whatever reasons.
