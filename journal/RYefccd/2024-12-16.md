CREATE TABLE regs as  SELECT * FROM read_json('data_row.json', columns = {date:'TIMESTAMPTZ', timestamp: 'INTEGER', ip: 'VARCHAR', phone: 'VARCHAR'});

# gpv

### 为了更好的观看数据，我们以分组排序来看看数据
select date,ip as g, phone as v, COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY g ORDER BY date) as gpv  from regs order by g, date;
### 线上看到的数据
select date,ip as g, phone as v, COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY g ORDER BY date) as gpv  from regs order by date;

# pv
## 再来看看 pv 的数据, 看看账号在ip请求了几次
select date,ip as g, phone as v, COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY g,v ORDER BY date) as pv  from regs order by g,v, date;
### 线上看到的数据
select date,ip as g, phone as v, COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY g,v ORDER BY date) as pv  from regs order by date;

# uv
## 看看账号在出现了几个ip
select date,ip as g, phone as v,COUNT(distinct v) OVER (PARTITION BY g ORDER BY date) as uv from regs order by g,date;
### 线上看到的数据
select date,ip as g, phone as v,COUNT(distinct v) OVER (PARTITION BY g ORDER BY date) as uv from regs order by date;


# group idle
### 求 group 上一次出现的时间
select date,ip as g, phone as v,lead(date, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY g ORDER BY date) as nxt_date from regs order by g,date;
### 求 group 按时间先后次序的逐差(当前时间减去上一次出现的时间)
select date,ip as g, phone as v, date - lag(date,1) OVER (PARTITION BY g ORDER BY date) as gidle from regs order by g,date;
### 把 interval 值转化为 int 
with tmp as (select date,ip as g, phone as v,date - lag(date,1) OVER (PARTITION BY g ORDER BY date) as gidle from regs order by g,date) select date,g,v,gidle,date_part('second',gidle) as gidle2int from tmp;


# vidle
### 求 group 按时间先后次序的逐差(当前时间减去上一次出现的时间)
select date,ip as g, phone as v, date - lag(date,1) OVER (PARTITION BY g,v ORDER BY date) as vidle from regs order by g,v,date;
