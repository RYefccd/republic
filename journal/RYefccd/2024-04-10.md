Dynamic memory allocation grants flexibility to programs that:

- do not know the size of arrays or other data structures until runtime (e.g. the size depends on user input)
    
- need to allow for a variety of input sizes (not just up to some fixed capacity)
    
- want to allocate exactly the size of data structures needed for a particular execution (don’t waste capacity)
    
- grow or shrink the sizes of memory allocated as the program runs, reallocating more space when needed and freeing up space when it’s no longer required.
